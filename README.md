# Numpy-Game-Of-Life
Hello everyone,
This is a small project made by following a Youtube Video because I wanted to learn the basics of numpy and pygame.
In this project you can play the famous game of life made by Conway (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)

At first I didn't want to watch the video and wanted to do the project by myself but I didn't use numpy, so I was able to print the grid and to turn the cells blacks when they were white, but I wasn't able to finish the game. So I changed my mind and thought it would be wiser to follow a video explaining numpy concepts. 
You can still check the first code in the "test" file if you want.
